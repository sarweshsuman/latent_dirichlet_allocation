Deep Learning in a Nutshell posts offer a high-level overview of essential concepts in deep learning. The posts aim to provide an understanding of each concept rather than its mathematical and theoretical details. While mathematical terminology is sometimes necessary and can further understanding, these posts use analogies and images whenever possible to provide easily digestible bits that make up an intuitive overview of the field of deep learning. Previous posts covered core concepts in deep learning, training of deep learning networks and their history, and sequence learning.
